# Review Section

Orchestrates review agents for quality assurance after completing a section. Reads project-specific configuration to determine which agents to run.

## Purpose

Catch issues early by running coordinated reviews after completing each section/chapter rather than waiting for full manuscript review.

## Configuration Discovery

The skill looks for review configuration in this order:

1. **Project config**: `Vault/Books/[Project]/work/review-config.md`
2. **Fallback default**: `.claude/defaults/review-config-default.md`

### Config Format

```yaml
---
project: "The Hush"
agents:
  - agent: prose-analysis
    modes: [voice, continuity, coherence, docs]
    voice_guide: "Vault/Books/The_Hush/work/prose_voice.md"
    documentation: "Vault/Books/The_Hush/work/TheHush_Complete_Documentation.md"
full_review_adds:
  - agent: ai-detector
report_path: "Work/reports/the-hush/"
---
```

Note: `prose-analysis` is now a single consolidated agent with mode flags:
- `--voice` — Voice enforcement, craft quality, show-don't-tell
- `--continuity` — Spatial tracking, timeline, pronouns
- `--coherence` — Escape hatches, worldbuilding verification
- `--docs` — Documentation verification (anti-hallucination)

### Fallback Default (no project config)

```yaml
agents:
  - agent: prose-analysis
    modes: [voice, continuity]
report_path: "Work/reports/"
```

## Usage

Review a section (all configured modes):
```
/review-section Vault/Books/The_Hush/The_Hush.md:🜍.2
```

Voice/craft review only:
```
/review-section Vault/Books/The_Hush/The_Hush.md:🜍.2 --voice
```

Facts-only review (continuity + docs):
```
/review-section Vault/Books/The_Hush/The_Hush.md:🜍.2 --continuity --docs
```

Full review (adds ai-detector if configured):
```
/review-section Vault/Books/The_Hush/The_Hush.md:🜍.2 --full
```

The skill:
1. Extracts project path from section path
2. Looks for `work/review-config.md` in that project
3. Falls back to default if not found
4. Runs configured agents in parallel where possible
5. Synthesizes combined report

## Section Identification

For The Hush, sections are identified by alchemical symbols:
- `🜍.2` — Sigils (Departure)
- `🜂.2` — Laudanum
- `🜄.0` — Orchard

For other projects, use line ranges or chapter names:
- `Chapter3:100-250` — Lines 100-250 of Chapter 3
- `Ch05` — Full chapter 5

## Output

Generates combined report at configured `report_path` containing:
- Executive summary with agent verdicts
- Detailed findings from each agent
- Prioritized action items
- Cross-agent synthesis (issues flagged by multiple agents)

## Agent Coordination

## Creating a Project Config

To set up review for a new project:

1. Create `Vault/Books/[YourProject]/work/review-config.md`
2. Define which agents to run and their configurations
3. Specify documentation paths for doc-verification
4. Set report output path

See `Vault/Books/The_Hush/work/review-config.md` for a complete example.

## Notes

- `--full` adds any agents listed in `full_review_adds` (typically ai-detector)
- Reports accumulate in configured path for trend analysis
- Run after every 2-3 sections during active drafting
