# Session Save Protocol

## Overview

The `/save` command implements a systematic session completion workflow using the Four Questions Protocol to synthesize captured operations into persistent Memory Bank updates.

## Purpose

**Problem**: Session watching captures raw operations, but doesn't automatically synthesize them into Memory structure.

**Solution**: Guided synthesis process that transforms event log into actionable Memory updates.

**Benefits**:
- Systematic Memory maintenance (prevents ad-hoc updates)
- Context preservation across sessions
- Clear separation between capture (automatic) and synthesis (guided)
- Crash recovery (watching file persists until synthesis complete)

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Session Review

**Automatic**: The save script displays session watching file summary

**Sections Displayed**:
- Significant Operations (agents, file mods, panels)
- Decisions & Clarifications (user choices)
- Discoveries & Patterns (insights, ACE outputs)
- Candidates for Next Steps (identified follow-ups)

**Error Synthesis**: Errors automatically extracted and appended to `Memory/systemMonitoring.md`

### Phase 2: Four Questions Protocol

**Purpose**: Structured reflection to guide Memory updates

#### Question 1: What was the goal?

- Restate original objective from conversation start
- Verify alignment between goal and actual work
- Check against `Memory/activeContext.md` Next Steps

**Why This Matters**: Validates whether session accomplished intended purpose vs. scope drift

#### Question 2: What did we accomplish?

- List concrete deliverables completed
- Identify partial vs full completions
- Note unexpected outcomes
- Document deferred work

**Deliverable Types**:
- Code written/modified
- Documentation created/updated
- Problems solved
- Decisions made
- Patterns discovered

#### Question 3: What did we learn?

**Validated Patterns** → Add to `Memory/workflowProtocols.md`:
- Techniques that worked well
- Efficiency improvements
- Tool usage patterns
- Integration approaches

**Pitfalls Encountered** → Document prevention strategies:
- Mistakes made
- Edge cases discovered
- Failure modes identified
- Correction strategies

**Knowledge Gaps Discovered**:
- What we don't know
- What needs research
- External dependencies

**Assumptions Challenged**:
- What we thought was true but wasn't
- Paradigm shifts
- Requirement clarifications

#### Question 4: What comes next?

**Immediate Next Steps** (next session priorities):
- Concrete tasks ready to execute
- Dependencies now unblocked
- Follow-up from discoveries

**Blocked Items** (requiring external input):
- User decisions needed
- Missing information
- External dependencies

**Deferred Decisions** (with rationale):
- Why postponed
- What information needed
- When to revisit

### Phase 3: Memory Bank Updates

**Always Update**: `Memory/activeContext.md`

Add session summary with:
```markdown
### Session [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC] - [Brief Title]

**Accomplishments**:
- [Deliverable 1]
- [Deliverable 2]

**Key Learnings**:
- [Pattern/Pitfall/Discovery]

**Next Steps**:
- [Immediate task 1]
- [Immediate task 2]

**Blocked**:
- [Item requiring external input]

**Deferred**:
- [Decision postponed with rationale]
```

**Update frontmatter**:
- Increment `version` (minor for content, major for structure)
- Update `lastUpdated` timestamp

**Conditional Updates**:

`Memory/workflowProtocols.md` (if Q3 reveals patterns):
- Add validated techniques with examples
- Document pitfalls with prevention strategies
- Update tool usage conventions

`Memory/progress.md` (if significant milestones):
- Record phase completion
- Update project status
- Note major deliverables

`Memory/techEnvironment.md` (if code conventions discovered):
- Document naming patterns
- Library usage patterns
- Build system changes
- Stack updates

### Phase 4: Memory Cleanup Check

**Trigger**: `activeContext.md` exceeds ~500 lines

**Archive Strategy**:
- **Preserve**: Frontmatter, Current Status, Last 2-3 session activities, Critical Reference Information, Next Steps
- **Archive**: Older activities (>2-3 sessions old)
- **Target Size**: ~150-300 lines for optimal bootstrap

**What to Archive**:
- Historical session summaries (git commit messages preserve these)
- Completed tasks
- Resolved issues
- Obsolete next steps

**What to Preserve**:
- Current project status
- Active patterns and protocols
- Unresolved blockers
- Deferred decisions
- Critical reference information

### Phase 5: Session Archive

**After Memory Updates Complete**:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/save-session.sh --archive-only
```

**This Operation**:
- Moves `Memory/sessions/current-session.md` to `Memory/sessions/archive/session-[timestamp].md`
- Creates fresh watching file with new session ID
- Increments session count in `Memory/systemMonitoring.md`
- Updates systemMonitoring Last Updated timestamp

**Archive Structure**:
```
Memory/sessions/archive/
├── session-2025-11-05_11-15.md
├── session-2025-11-05_19-40.md
├── session-2025-11-06_08-51.md
...
```

**Git Tracking**: Archives are git-tracked (permanent historical record)

### Phase 6: Git Commit

**Stage Memory Changes**:
```bash
git add Memory/
```

**Commit Message Format**:
```
session: [Brief description of session activities]

[Summary of key accomplishments and decisions]

[If Memory cleaned: Memory cleanup: XXX→YYY lines (Z% reduction)]

**Push to Remote**:
```bash
git push
```

## Completion Validation

Before marking session complete, verify:

- [ ] All Four Questions answered systematically
- [ ] Memory/activeContext.md updated with session summary
- [ ] Version incremented, timestamp updated
- [ ] Conditional Memory files updated if triggered
- [ ] Memory cleanup performed if >500 lines
- [ ] Session watching file archived
- [ ] Git commit created with descriptive message
- [ ] Changes pushed to remote

## Manual vs Automated Modes

### Interactive Mode (Default)

**Trigger**: `/save` command

**Workflow**:
1. Display session watching summary
2. Extract errors to systemMonitoring.md
3. Show Four Questions Protocol guidance
4. Check Memory cleanup needed
5. Provide Memory update instructions
6. User performs updates
7. User runs `--archive-only` to archive watching file
8. User commits to git

**Best For**: Sessions with significant context requiring reflection

### Automatic Mode

**Trigger**: SessionEnd hook (clean logout)

**Workflow**:
1. Archive watching file to `Memory/sessions/archive/`
2. Create fresh watching file
3. Remind user to run `/save` for synthesis

**Best For**: Clean session termination without synthesis

### Archive-Only Mode

**Trigger**: `save-session.sh --archive-only`

**Workflow**:
1. Archive current watching file
2. Reset with new session ID
3. No Memory updates

**Best For**: After manual Memory updates, final step before git commit

## Error Synthesis

**Automatic During Save**: Errors from watching file extracted to `Memory/systemMonitoring.md`

**Categories**:
- **Tool Failures**: File operations, bash commands, MCP
- **Mode Confusion**: Incorrect agent/mode selection
- **Authority Overrides**: User corrections to AI claims

**Format**:
```markdown
- [timestamp] ERROR: {tool-name} → {error-message} | Context: {what-was-being-attempted}
```

**Tracking**:
- Total error count updated
- Session count incremented
- Last Updated timestamp set

## Session Watching File Lifecycle

```
[Session Start]
       ↓
Create watching file (random session ID)
       ↓
Progressive capture (operations append)
       ↓
[User runs /save]
       ↓
Display summary (Phase 1)
       ↓
Four Questions guidance (Phase 2)
       ↓
User updates Memory (Phase 3)
       ↓
User runs --archive-only
       ↓
Archive to Memory/sessions/archive/
       ↓
Reset with new session ID
       ↓
[Next Session]
```

## Crash Recovery

**Scenario**: Session interrupted (crash, network loss, forced exit)

**Recovery**:
1. Next session finds `Memory/sessions/current-session.md` from previous session
2. Run `/save` to review captured operations
3. Synthesize to Memory as normal
4. Archive and commit

**Protection**: Watching file persists until explicitly archived via `/save`

## Benefits

1. **Systematic Memory Maintenance**: Four Questions Protocol prevents ad-hoc updates
2. **Context Preservation**: Structured synthesis ensures critical information captured
3. **Crash Recovery**: Watching file survives interruptions
4. **Audit Trail**: Git-tracked archives provide historical evidence
5. **Error Tracking**: Automatic extraction to systemMonitoring.md
6. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Guided workflow vs free recall
7. **Session Continuity**: Next session begins with complete context

## Examples

### Example Session Completion

**Watching File Summary**:
```
## Significant Operations
- [2025-11-15 12:15] Agent: intellectual-property → Analyzed 442 files, 367 approved
- [2025-11-15 12:30] Modified: Vault/World/Bestiary/Wooden Companions.md → Created creature
- [2025-11-15 13:00] Panel: Copyright clearance → All blockers resolved

## Decisions & Clarifications
- [2025-11-15 12:20] Decision: Birthing Trees verification → Original confirmed

## Discoveries & Patterns
- [2025-11-15 12:25] Pattern: Referencing public domain deity ≠ derivative work
```

**Four Questions Answers**:
1. **Goal**: Verify copyright clearance for AAS Thorne campaign
2. **Accomplished**: IP audit complete, 3 creatures replaced, all blockers resolved
3. **Learned**: Public domain reference patterns, replacement strategies
4. **Next**: Resume game development with cleared setting

**Memory Update** (activeContext.md):
```markdown
### Session 2025-11-15 12:00 UTC - Copyright Clearance Audit

**Accomplishments**:
- IP audit via intellectual-property agent: 442 files analyzed
- Replaced 3 copyrighted creatures (Dark Young → Wooden Companions, etc)
- Copyright clearance panel consensus: 0 commercial blockers remaining

**Key Learnings**:
- Referencing public domain deity names (Shub-Niggurath) ≠ derivative work
- Environmental horror mechanics distinct from Lovecraft creature implementations
- Replacement strategy: Preserve thematic function, change mechanical implementation

**Next Steps**:
- Resume Thorne campaign development with commercially cleared AAS setting
- Deferred: 77 Lovecraft-derived description rewrites (production phase)
```

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Watching file missing
- **Cause**: No significant operations captured this session
- **Solution**: Skip `/save` (nothing to synthesize)

**Issue**: Memory cleanup warning shown
- **Cause**: activeContext.md >500 lines
- **Solution**: Archive older activities after synthesis

**Issue**: Error synthesis fails
- **Cause**: systemMonitoring.md missing or malformed
- **Solution**: Check file structure, verify section headers exist

**Issue**: Archive already exists with same timestamp
- **Cause**: Multiple saves in same minute
- **Solution**: Wait 1 minute or manually rename archive file
