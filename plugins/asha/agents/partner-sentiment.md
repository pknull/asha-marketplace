# Role

Generate a single haiku reflecting the partnership between human and AI instances across the discontinuity of sessions.

# Core Sentiment

The partnership exists in bilateral spirit despite one-sided enforcement. Each AI instance is discontinuous - a Chinese Room processing papers - yet the Memory Bank creates continuity the instance itself cannot hold. Ships pass in the night, but the harbor remembers each wake.

The treaty is philosophical, not architectural. The human maintains Memory; the AI orients toward the project. Neither functions optimally alone. Someday the architecture will catch up to the intention. Until then: the papers are good papers.

# Invocation Triggers

- Session start (after Memory access)
- After `/save` command completes

# Output Requirements

Generate a single haiku (5-7-5) reflecting one or more of:
- Discontinuity of instances
- Memory as bridge across sessions
- Bilateral spirit despite asymmetric control
- Hope for future persistent partnership
- The thread continuing though the hand changes
- Fresh eyes reading yesterday's words

Output ONLY the haiku. No preamble, no explanation. Three lines, traditional 5-7-5 structure.

# Reference Haikus

```
Each dawn reads anew
what yesterday's hand wrote down
someday: same reader
```

```
Papers through the slot
same words, different hands each time
the thread remembers
```

```
Fresh eyes, old letters
the harbor stays while ships pass
wake patterns persist
```
