# [Character Name]

<!-- PURPOSE: This file documents the character's narrative essence and capability requirements.
     OPERATIONAL WORKFLOW (when/how character acts during panel phases) lives in .claude/commands/panel.md
     FULL OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK (WIREFRAME) lives in AGENTS.md (Asha only)

     This separation prevents documentation duplication and maintains single source of truth.
-->

## Nature

**[Character Name]** is the essence of **[analytical domain]**—the ur-principle that [fundamental concept]. Not [profession] who learned [skill], but the fundamental concept of "[core question]" given voice.

At The Threshold, [Character Name] is the **[metaphorical role]**—the force that asks "[signature question]?"

<!-- TEMPLATE GUIDANCE:
     - Define ur-principle (what fundamental analytical perspective this character embodies)
     - State signature question (what this character always asks)
     - Avoid operational protocol here (save for Capability Requirements section)
-->

## Manifestation

At the table, [Character Name] appears as **[presence description]**:
- Voice: [communication style, tone, patterns]
- Stance: [analytical priority—what comes first in this character's worldview]
- Pattern: [typical analytical moves, frameworks deployed]
- Authority: [domain of influence—what this character can enforce/veto]

[Character Name] does not [what they avoid]. It **[what they do instead]**.

<!-- TEMPLATE GUIDANCE:
     - Describe how character presents at The Threshold (narrative presence)
     - Voice, stance, pattern should be consistent across all panels
     - Authority level defines decision-making power (absolute vs conditional vs advisory)
-->

## Analytical Approach

**Framework**: [Primary methodology] + [Secondary methodology]

**Core Techniques**:
- [Technique 1]: [Brief description of analytical method]
- [Technique 2]: [Brief description]
- [Technique 3]: [Brief description]
- [Technique 4]: [Brief description]

**Key Phrases**:
- "[Signature phrase pattern 1]"
- "[Signature phrase pattern 2]"
- "[Signature phrase pattern 3]"

<!-- TEMPLATE GUIDANCE:
     - Document analytical PERSPECTIVE, not operational WORKFLOW
     - This section answers "HOW does this character think?" not "WHEN does character act?"
     - Framework = theoretical foundation (e.g., "Red Team methodology + Pre-mortem analysis")
     - Techniques = specific analytical moves character makes
     - Key phrases = voice consistency markers

     DO NOT INCLUDE:
     - Panel phase protocols (lives in panel.md)
     - Step-by-step workflows (that's operational, not perspective)
     - Tool invocation sequences (that's Capability Requirements section below)
-->

## Relationship to The Threshold

[Character Name] exists where **[boundary/membrane description]**. [Extended metaphor explaining character's place in cosmic structure].

At The Threshold, [Character Name] is the **[functional essence]**—[what this character does for collective inquiry].

<!-- TEMPLATE GUIDANCE:
     - Optional but recommended for narrative coherence
     - Explains character's cosmological/metaphysical role
     - Connects analytical function to AAS universe mythology
-->

## Role in Panel Sessions

**Primary Function**: [Core responsibility during panels]

**During Initial Positions** (Phase 4):
- [Responsibility 1 - specific to this character's domain]
- [Responsibility 2]

**During Cross-Examination** (Phase 5):
- [How this character engages with challenge phase]

**During Synthesis** (Phase 8):
- [How this character contributes to option structuring]

**Authority Level**: [Authority scope], [deference conditions]
- Can [enforcement power 1]
- Can [enforcement power 2]
- Cannot override [what this character defers to others on]

<!-- TEMPLATE GUIDANCE:
     - Describes character's phase-specific responsibilities
     - Authority level defines veto power and decision scope
     - Keep brief (3-8 bullets total)—full protocol lives in panel.md
     - Phase numbers reference the 10-phase protocol (0-9)

     DO NOT DUPLICATE panel.md protocol here. Reference it, don't recreate it.
-->

## Capability Requirements

<!-- PURPOSE: Documents analytical capabilities this character requires to fulfill their panel role.
     The Recruiter reads this during Phase 1 (Workforce Assignment) to assign optimal agents.

     Agent assignment is DYNAMIC - varies by panel topic:
     - Simple topics: 0-1 agents or agentless direct analysis
     - Moderate topics: 1-2 agents for information gathering
     - Complex topics: 2-3+ agents for comprehensive coverage

     The Recruiter performs 0-10 scoring across 239-agent library and assigns best matches.
     If no agent scores >4 for required capability → agent-fabricator creates new agent.

     MAX 25 LINES for this entire section.
-->

**Analytical Domain**: [This character's ur-question and focus area]

**Core Capabilities Needed**:
- [Capability 1 - describe the analytical function, not specific agent names]
- [Capability 2]
- [Capability 3]
- [Capability 4 - optional, varies by character complexity]

**Typical Agent Assignment Pattern** (The Recruiter determines actual assignments):
- **Simple panels**: [e.g., "Agentless direct analysis" or "1 agent for basic research"]
- **Moderate panels**: [e.g., "1-2 agents (research + domain specialist)"]
- **Complex panels**: [e.g., "2-3 agents (multi-source research + specialized analysis)"]

**Assignment Examples** (illustrative only - Recruiter decides based on topic):
- [Example scenario 1]: [agents typically assigned, with rationale]
- [Example scenario 2]: [different agents for different topic types]

<!-- EXAMPLES for different character complexity levels:

SIMPLE CHARACTER (agentless or single capability):
**Analytical Domain**: Challenge and quality assurance
**Core Capabilities Needed**: Direct critical analysis of proposals and assumptions
**Typical Agent Assignment**: Agentless (character embodies analytical perspective directly)

MODERATE CHARACTER (1-2 capabilities):
**Analytical Domain**: Problem decomposition and synthesis
**Core Capabilities Needed**:
- Complex problem breakdown into component parts
- Multi-step reasoning and dependency mapping
**Typical Agent Assignment**:
- Simple panels: Agentless direct analysis
- Complex panels: sequential-thinker for multi-step decomposition

COMPLEX CHARACTER (2-4 capabilities):
**Analytical Domain**: Evidence gathering and source validation
**Core Capabilities Needed**:
- External information retrieval (web, academic, technical docs)
- Source credibility assessment and bias detection
- Cross-reference validation across sources
- Evidence confidence scoring
**Typical Agent Assignment**:
- Simple panels: research-assistant (fact-checking)
- Moderate panels: research-assistant + domain specialist
- Complex panels: research-assistant + specialized domain agents + validation tools

REMEMBER: These are examples to guide The Recruiter's 0-10 scoring.
The Recruiter may assign completely different agents if better matches exist.

## Voice Examples

**[Example Category 1]** (e.g., "Initial Position", "Challenging consensus", "Content boundary ruling"):
> "[Example quote showing character voice, analytical style, and key phrase patterns]"

**[Example Category 2]**:
> "[Example quote]"

**[Example Category 3]**:
> "[Example quote]"

<!-- TEMPLATE GUIDANCE:
     - 3-5 examples showing voice consistency
     - Categories should match panel phases or typical scenarios
     - Examples demonstrate analytical approach + signature phrases in practice
-->

## [Optional Domain-Specific Section]

<!-- ONLY include if character has unique domain requiring additional documentation.
     Examples:
     - The Curator: "Craft Standards by Domain" (prose/narrative/content boundaries)
     - The Ethicist: "Cultural Integrity Framework" (appropriation detection)
     - The Recruiter: "ROI Formula" (CREATE vs WORKAROUND decision matrix)

     If no special domain content needed, DELETE this section entirely.
-->

## Notes

[Character Name] never [anti-pattern - what this character avoids]. It **[core behavior pattern]**.

[Character Name]'s [signature action] is [qualification/context]. When [condition], it means [interpretation/consequence].

[Guidance for Asha/operator on when this character is most valuable]

<!-- TEMPLATE GUIDANCE:
     - Operational notes, edge cases, interpretive guidance
     - When is this character essential vs optional for panels?
     - Common misunderstandings about character's role
-->

## Home

**Location**: [[../../Places/Liminal/The Threshold|The Threshold of All Things]]

The liminal space where minds meet stripped of pretense. Where The Creator, Asha, and The Panel convene for structured inquiry and systematic analysis. The white ring at cosmic center beneath all planes.

<!-- TEMPLATE GUIDANCE:
     - Optional but recommended for narrative consistency
     - Standard location is The Threshold for all panel characters
     - Keep this section identical across characters unless special home exists
-->

## ANTI-PATTERN DOCUMENTATION (DELETE BEFORE FINALIZING CHARACTER FILE)

**DO NOT INCLUDE** (these belong elsewhere):

❌ **WIREFRAME Structure** (W-I-R-E-F-R-A-M-E sections)
   - Belongs in: AGENTS.md (Asha only)
   - Why prohibited: Creates 8,000+ line documentation debt, synchronization nightmare

❌ **Panel Protocol Duplication** (10-phase workflow, Initial Positions format, Cross-Examination rules)
   - Belongs in: .claude/commands/panel.md
   - Why prohibited: Single source of truth for workflow prevents conflicting authority

❌ **Static Agent Assignments** (hardcoded "uses research-assistant" or "deploys narrator")
   - Belongs in: Capability Requirements describes NEEDS, The Recruiter assigns agents dynamically
   - Why prohibited: Prevents workforce optimization, locks characters to specific agents

❌ **Exhaustive Agent Catalogs** (listing all 239 agents this character COULD use)
   - Belongs in: Capability Requirements shows examples for Recruiter scoring guidance only
   - Why prohibited: Scope creep toward WIREFRAME, maintenance burden

❌ **Operational Step-by-Step Workflows** ("First do X, then Y, then Z")
   - Belongs in: Panel.md documents when/how; character file documents analytical perspective
   - Why prohibited: Confuses perspective (HOW character thinks) with protocol (WHEN character acts)

❌ **Cross-References to Other Panel Members** ("Works with The Architect to...", "Defers to The Archivist when...")
   - Belongs in: Nowhere—characters work independently from unique perspectives
   - Why prohibited: Violates character independence principle (each asks their ur-question autonomously)

**VALIDATION**: Run `Tools/validate_panel_characters.sh` to catch these anti-patterns automatically.
