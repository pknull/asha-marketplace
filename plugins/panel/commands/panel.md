# Panel - Expert Multi-Perspective Analysis

Convene a panel with 3 core roles + dynamically recruited specialists who analyze your topic from distinct perspectives and produce a structured decision through an 11-phase protocol.

## Usage

```bash
/panel How do we pimp fish
/panel Should we implement GraphQL or REST for the new API
/panel Evaluate Chapter 9's horror-erotica effectiveness
```

### Options

```bash
/panel --format=github "Topic here"     # Output as GitHub PR comment
/panel --format=json "Topic here"       # Output as structured JSON
/panel --context=docs/RFC.md "Topic"    # Inject reference material
/panel --context=spec.md --format=github "Evaluate this proposal"
```

### Panel Management

```bash
/panel --list                    # List all panels (active and completed)
/panel --list --status=active    # List only active/interrupted panels
/panel --list --status=completed # List only completed panels
/panel --list --status=abandoned # List abandoned panels
/panel --show <id>               # Display panel summary by ID
/panel --resume <id>             # Resume interrupted panel from last phase
/panel --abandon <id>            # Mark panel as abandoned
```

**Flags**:
- `--format=<type>`: Output format (`markdown` default, `github`, `json`)
- `--context=<file>`: Pre-load reference material into panel context
- `--list`: List panels in index (combine with `--status` to filter)
- `--status=<type>`: Filter for `--list` (`active`, `completed`, `abandoned`)
- `--show <id>`: Display summary of specific panel
- `--resume <id>`: Continue panel from last completed phase
- `--abandon <id>`: Mark panel as abandoned (cannot resume)

**That's it.** The panel handles everything automatically:
- The Analyst analyzes topic and recruits 2-5 specialist agents from available library
- Assigns specialists with evocative session-specific names
- Infers goals from topic context
- Applies consensus decision rule (unanimous for security topics)
- The Challenger argues against proposals and demands proof of necessity
- The Moderator moderates and compiles the decision report

## Core Roles (Always Present)

**The Moderator** (Moderator/Facilitator)
- Manages 11-phase protocol execution
- Ensures procedural integrity and timebox enforcement
- Synthesizes final decision report
- **Question**: "What is the PROCESS?"

**The Analyst** (Workforce Intelligence)
- Analyzes topic to determine needed expertise
- Scores available agent library (0-10) for capability match
- Recruits 2-5 specialist agents with session-specific names
- Deploys `agent-fabricator` if capability gaps detected
- **Question**: "Who has CAPABILITY?"

**The Challenger** (Opposition & Quality Gate)
- **Default stance: OPPOSE** - argues against proposals and defends status quo
- Demands evidence before changing working systems: "Show me user complaints, failure data, metrics"
- Forces proponents to prove necessity: "The current system works. Prove it doesn't."
- Prevents premature action and consensus formed without data
- **Question**: "Why should we do this at all?"

## Dynamic Panelists (Recruited Per Topic)

The Analyst assigns agents from `.claude/agents/*.md` with **evocative session-specific names** based on topic context.

**Examples by Topic Type**:

**Creative Writing Panel** (Callum Chapter 9 evaluation):
- `prose-analysis` → **"The Editor"** (craft assessment)
- `intimacy-designer` → **"The Architect of Dread"** (genre mechanics)
- `narrative-architect` → **"The Structuralist"** (story coherence)
- `character-developer` → **"The Psychologist"** (character authenticity)

**Technical Architecture Panel** (GraphQL vs REST):
- `research-assistant` → **"The Evidence Gatherer"** (source validation)
- `architect` → **"The Systems Designer"** (architecture patterns)
- `ml-engineer` → **"The Model Capability Analyst"** (performance analysis)

**Culinary Innovation Panel** (How do we pimp fish):
- `research-assistant` → **"The Culinary Historian"** (technique research)
- `trend-analyst` → **"The Flavor Prophet"** (emerging patterns)
- `creative-director` → **"The Presentation Architect"** (plating design)

**Session-Specific Naming Convention**:
- **Agent role** describes what it does (e.g., `prose-analysis`)
- **Session name** describes who it becomes for this panel (e.g., "The Editor")
- Names should be evocative, contextual, and domain-appropriate

## 11-Phase Protocol

**Phase -1: Topic Analysis & Workforce Recruitment** (The Analyst)
- **Initialize persistence**:
  * Generate panel ID: `YYYY-MM-DD--<slug>` (slug from topic, lowercase, hyphens)
  * Create directory: `Work/panels/<id>/`
  * Initialize state.json with status `active`
  * Add entry to `Work/panels/index.json`
- Analyze topic domain (technical, creative, research-heavy, security-critical)
- Determine required expertise areas (2-5 domains typical)
- Search agent library systematically (`.claude/agents/*.md`)
- Score agents 0-10 for topic capability match:
  * 10: Perfect specialist match
  * 7-9: Strong capabilities alignment
  * 4-6: Partial match, can handle with coordination
  * 1-3: Poor match, inefficient
  * 0: No coverage, gap identified
- Assign specialists with session-specific names (e.g., `prose-analysis` → "The Editor")
- Deploy `agent-fabricator` if gaps detected (no agent scores >4)
- Set decision rule (consensus default, unanimous for security)
- Infer primary goals from topic context
- **Write phase file**: `phase-00-recruitment.md`
- **Update state.json**: Record panel composition, goals, decision rule

**Phase 0: Goal Clarification** (The Moderator)
- Request clarification if topic is ambiguous or underspecified
- Formalize refined topic statement
- Skip if topic is already well-specified

**Phase 1: Framing** (The Moderator)
- State topic, inferred goals, constraints, decision rule
- Introduce panel composition:
  * Core roles (The Moderator, Analyst, Challenger)
  * Recruited specialists with session names
- Explain recruitment rationale (why these specialists for this topic)
- Establish complete panel composition before Initial Positions

**Phase 2: Infrastructure Check** (The Moderator)
- Compare proposals against existing assets to avoid duplication:
  * Memory files (workflowProtocols.md, activeContext.md)
  * Commands (/panel, /save, /notes, /validate-vault)
  * Agents (research-assistant, narrator, etc.)
- Output "Existing Infrastructure Comparison"
- Redirect to enhancement if duplicative

**Phase 3: Initial Positions** (All Panelists)
- Each specialist (via recruited agent) gathers information and analyzes from their domain
- The Challenger takes opposition stance: "DON'T do this because..." and demands proof
- Synthesize into 5-bullet brief: Position, Evidence, Risks, Unknowns, Recommendation
- Present findings with citations

**Phase 4: Cross-Examination** (The Challenger-led)
- The Challenger challenges assumptions, finds contradictions and failure modes
- Specialists respond from their domain perspectives
- Analyst may assign additional agents if challenges reveal capability gaps

**Phase 5: Research Gate** (The Moderator)
- If evidence gaps block decisions, authorize additional research
- Direct specialists to run targeted queries using assigned agents
- Analyst may assign additional specialized agents if insufficient
- Enforce Confidence Scoring: Relevance, Completeness, Confidence Score
- Thresholds: <0.6 Insufficient | 0.6–0.79 Preliminary | ≥0.8 High confidence

**Phase 6: Reflection Round** (All Panelists)
- Review Cross-Examination arguments and Research Gate findings
- Revise Initial Positions if persuaded by evidence or challenges
- Submit updated briefs acknowledging what changed and why
- The Moderator identifies convergence or remaining disagreements

**Phase 7: Synthesis** (Recruited Architect or The Moderator)
- Analyze updated briefs and structure viable options with tradeoffs
- Articulate decision pathways and implications
- If complex synthesis needed, Analyst may assign architecture specialist

**Phase 8: Decision** (The Moderator)
- Apply decision rule (consensus/unanimous based on topic)
- Calculate consensus percentage: (aligned panelists / total panelists) × 100
- Record dissent with percentage weight and rationale
- Threshold interpretation:
  * **100%**: Unanimous agreement
  * **80-99%**: Strong consensus (proceed with noted concerns)
  * **60-79%**: Moderate consensus (address dissent before proceeding)
  * **<60%**: Weak consensus (requires additional deliberation or escalation)
- List Next Steps with owners, deliverables, due dates
- **Write phase file**: `phase-08-decision.md`
- **Finalize persistence**:
  * Write `transcript.md` (full panel transcript)
  * Update state.json: status `completed`, final decision, consensus
  * Update index.json with decision summary

**Per-Phase Persistence** (all phases):
After completing each phase, update `state.json`:
- Increment `current_phase`
- Add phase number to `completed_phases`
- Update `updated` timestamp
- Store phase-specific data (positions, findings, etc.)

## Decision Report (Fixed Output)

Every panel produces a structured decision report:

- **Topic** (including Phase 0 clarifications if applicable)
- **Context Materials** (if `--context` used: file summaries and key points)
- **Inferred Goals** (derived from topic analysis)
- **Decision Rule** (consensus or unanimous)
- **Panel Composition**:
  * Core Roles (The Moderator, Analyst, Challenger)
  * Recruited Specialists (agent → session name mapping with scores)
  * Recruitment Rationale (why these specialists for this topic)
- **Existing Infrastructure Comparison** (Phase 2 findings)
- **Expert Briefs** (Phase 3 Initial Positions with agent-gathered evidence)
- **Cross-Examination Findings** (Phase 4 challenges and responses)
- **Research Findings** (Phase 5 sources, if Research Gate activated)
- **Confidence Summary** (Relevance, Completeness, Score, Threshold)
- **Reflection Round Summary** (Phase 6 revised positions, convergence)
- **Synthesis** (Phase 7 options/tradeoffs)
- **Decision** (Phase 8 final determination)
- **Consensus** (percentage, threshold level, dissent summary)
- **Next Steps** (actionable items with ownership)

### JSON (`--format=json`)
Structured data for programmatic consumption:

```json
{
  "topic": "string",
  "goals": ["string"],
  "decision_rule": "consensus|unanimous",
  "panel": {
    "core": ["The Moderator", "Analyst", "Challenger"],
    "specialists": [{"agent": "string", "session_name": "string", "score": 0-10}]
  },
  "consensus": {
    "percentage": 85,
    "threshold": "strong|moderate|weak|unanimous",
    "aligned": 4,
    "total": 5
  },
  "decision": "string",
  "dissent": [{"role": "string", "rationale": "string", "weight": 15}],
  "next_steps": [{"action": "string", "owner": "string", "deliverable": "string"}],
  "confidence": {"relevance": 0.0-1.0, "completeness": 0.0-1.0, "score": 0.0-1.0}
}
```

## Context Injection

The `--context` flag pre-loads reference material before panel deliberation:

```bash
/panel --context=docs/RFC-001.md "Should we adopt this RFC?"
/panel --context=Memory/techEnvironment.md "Evaluate caching strategy"
```

**Behavior**:
1. Read specified file(s) before Phase -1
2. Include content summary in Phase 1 Framing
3. Make content available to all panelists during deliberation
4. Reference in Decision Report under "Context Materials"

**Multiple contexts**:
```bash
/panel --context=spec.md --context=constraints.md "Evaluate feasibility"
```

**URL context** (if WebFetch available):
```bash
/panel --context=https://example.com/api-docs "Design integration approach"
```

## Dynamic Agent Recruitment Architecture

**Core Roles vs Recruited Specialists**:
- **Core Roles** = Persistent panel infrastructure (The Moderator, Analyst, Challenger)
- **Recruited Specialists** = Topic-specific experts from agent library with session names

**Recruitment Flow**:
1. **Phase -1**: Analyst analyzes topic → determines expertise needs → scores agents → assigns with session names
2. **Phase 3**: Specialists deploy assigned agents for research and analysis
3. **Phase 4-5**: Analyst may assign additional agents if gaps detected
4. **Phase 7**: Analyst may assign architecture specialist for complex synthesis

**Session-Specific Naming**:
- Same agent becomes different "character" depending on context
- `prose-analysis` → "The Editor" (creative), "The Code Reviewer" (technical), "The Stylist" (marketing)
- `research-assistant` → "The Archivist" (historical), "The Evidence Gatherer" (legal), "The Data Scout" (analytics)
- Names should reflect domain context and analytical role

**Gap Detection & Agent Creation**:
If no agent scores >4 for required capability → Analyst deploys `agent-fabricator` to create new specialized agent during Phase -1.

## Character Files

Core roles have documented profiles in `plugins/panel/docs/characters/`:
- **The Moderator.md** - Moderator/Facilitator
- **The Analyst.md** - Workforce Intelligence
- **The Challenger.md** - Opposition & Quality Gate

Recruited specialists are documented in `.claude/agents/*.md` (agent count varies by host project).

## Persistence Architecture

Panels are saved to `Work/panels/` with full state for resumption and audit.

```

### Resume Protocol

When `--resume <id>` is invoked:

1. Load `Work/panels/<id>/state.json`
2. Verify status is `active` (not `completed` or `abandoned`)
3. Read completed phase files to restore context
4. Continue from `current_phase + 1`
5. Update state.json after each phase completion

### Abandon Protocol

When `--abandon <id>` is invoked:

1. Load state.json
2. Set `status: "abandoned"`
3. Update index.json
4. Panel cannot be resumed after abandonment

## Management Command Protocols

### --list Protocol

1. Read `Work/panels/index.json` (create if missing)
2. Filter by `--status` if provided
3. Display table:
   ```
   ID                          | Status    | Phase | Topic                    | Updated
   ----------------------------|-----------|-------|--------------------------|-------------------
   2026-01-29--graphql-vs-rest | completed | 8     | GraphQL vs REST for API  | 2026-01-29 11:45
   2026-01-28--fish-enhancement| active    | 4     | How do we pimp fish      | 2026-01-28 16:20
   ```

### --show Protocol

1. Load `Work/panels/<id>/state.json`
2. Display summary:
   - Topic, status, decision rule
   - Panel composition with session names
   - Completed phases list
   - Current phase (if active)
   - Decision and consensus (if completed)

### --resume Protocol

1. Validate panel exists and status is `active`
2. Load state.json and all completed phase files
3. Reconstruct panel context:
   - Goals, decision rule, context files
   - Panel composition with session names
   - Positions from completed phases
4. Announce: "Resuming panel '<topic>' from Phase N"
5. Continue protocol from next incomplete phase
6. Update state.json after each phase
7. Update index.json on completion

### --abandon Protocol

1. Validate panel exists and status is `active`
2. Set status to `abandoned` in state.json
3. Update index.json
4. Confirm: "Panel '<topic>' marked abandoned"

## Notes

- **Persistence**: All panels saved to `Work/panels/` for audit and resumption
- **Phase files**: Each phase writes to separate file for granular recovery
- **Dynamic recruitment**: No static panelists—Analyst assigns 2-5 specialists per topic
- **Session-specific names**: Agents given evocative contextual names for panel depth
- **Evidence standards**: Use markers where appropriate: [Inference], [Speculation], [Unverified]
- **Optional phases**: Skip Phase 0 if topic well-specified, skip Phase 6 for simple decisions
- **Tool segregation**: Memory/Tools via filesystem; Vault via Obsidian tools; BookStack via MCP
- **Core role consistency**: The Moderator, Analyst, Challenger always present; specialists vary by topic

## Pattern Implementation

Based on CSIRO Agent Design Patterns (Liu et al. 2025):
- **Passive Goal Creator** (Phase 0): Clarifies ambiguous topics
- **Role-Based Cooperation**: Core roles with hierarchical workflow
- **Debate-Based Cooperation**: Cross-Examination phase enables argument exchange
- **Self-Reflection**: Reflection Round allows position revision
- **Cross-Reflection**: Specialists review each other's arguments
- **Human Reflection**: Decision Report enables user contestability
