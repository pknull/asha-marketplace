## Decisions & Clarifications
- [2025-11-20 11:43 UTC] User: Save it and push it up
- [2025-11-20 11:41 UTC] User: You could update the template with instructions in each section
- [2025-11-20 11:40 UTC] User: It looked as though you told the tools what to do, instead of just using the template.
- [2025-11-20 11:38 UTC] User: Can you make sure the recruiter, wheen making a new agent, uses the _template in our docs folder?
